# Junior_Software_Engineer_Test
Doghero test case in selection process to Junior Software Engineer position

## Day by day
Here I'm going to register all my activities. The main idea it's learn about Angular on Rails and do some work in each of the 7 available days.

### Day 1
After reading the test case, Angular on Rails seemed to me be the best choice. It's a mix of things that I already have worked (basic Angular app) and new challanges, such as Ruby on Rails. All languages and techs that I really wanted to learn, so win win situation :)
Also, I drew my workflow that I pretend to follow:
* Set up Angular and Ruby environment.
* Define client, dog and dog walker requirements. Which information is going to be stored.
* Draw all screens. Starting with the input screens and then the presentation ones.
* Learn basic Ruby on Rails and set up API.
* Quick angular review. Set up Angular project.
* Connect API and front-end.
* Deploy on Heroku.

Thus, all environment was set in day 1. Beginning with git and this repository at GitHub and after in my PC with NodeJS and Angular and Ruby on Rails.
